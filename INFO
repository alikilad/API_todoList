How to run the project:
  For the api go to the folder interview\API_todoList\api\TodoList_api and run on the terminal dotnet run.
  For the client go to the folder interview\API_todoList\client\Todolist_Client and run on the terminal npm run dev.

Status of the project:
The api can update the database
The client cannot fetch data from or to the database. The error is located to this part of the code: 
  const response = await  axios.post('/api/task', newTask);
  tasks.value.push(response.data)  // Add the new task to the list

The push value expects an array , but the response is an html page. I am working on it to find why
